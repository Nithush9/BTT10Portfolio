<FONT SIZE=6>After looking at all the Catholic Graduate Expectations I feel like my work is most connected to one of them. The one it's most connected to is the fourth expectation which is "A SELF-DIRECTED, RESPONSIBLE, LIFE-LONG LEARNER".  My work is most connected to this because, during this CPT, I did lots of self-directed learning about HTML to learn how to do and add different things to my portfolio.  I set goals for myself to achieve and I was able to achieve all the goals I wanted during this assignment.  I applied effective communication, decision-making, problem-solving, time, and resource management skills. Also was able to show lots of flexibility and adaptability by being able to face struggles and triumph over them. This is why I think that my portfolio is connected to the Catholic Graduate Expectation.</FONT><P>
